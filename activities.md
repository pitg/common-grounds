# Pinoy IT Geeks Activities

### Introduction

This is a rough draft for group activities for members to partake in a weekly basis. Every week participants will have the chance to expose themselves in various concepts, methodologies, ethics, outside the standard educational paradigm. That being said, now you're wondering what are there to learn?
