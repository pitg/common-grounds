# Pinoy I.T. Geeks' Guidelines
The rules are now known as guidelines from hence forth. The guidelines will explain social etiquette regarding posts and moderation under the jurisdiction of the group.

### How PITG runs?
PITG is runned as a meritocracy, that is if you have credentials or accurate knowledge in a given IT field, you are most welcome to discuss, otherwise practice your preferred craft before you enter into a discussion.  [Meritocracy definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy)

### Speech & Opinion
1. Ad Hominem : Simple speaking "to the person", it is a statement directed to the person instead to the argument. Just be reminded that in the event of flaks to whomever is involved; Do not resort to Ad hominem for the reason of prejudice. 

2. Respect : To simple things out, respect is earned and given not demanded nor asked. If you want to be respected read *Posting & Answering Questions #1*

3. Imperative Sarcasm : It is a part of the group's culture to include imperative sarcasm to their statements to give spice to the topic. Sarcasm may be considered as *relative trolling*.

4. Trolling : It's norm, get over it.

5. Don't be a cry baby, you're only seeing the tip of the iceberg of the real world.

### Posting & Answering Content/Questions
1. When posting questions, be sure that they are descriptive as possible, and make sure that no single important detail is left behind; Do not take vagueness into account like "who knows x, i have a problem". Ask intelligently to avoid flak from moderators or mainstays.

2. Spoonfeeding has been frowned upon, you may only give hints to the asker and let them solve their own problem on their own. **EXCEPT AND IF** the problem cannot be reproduced or recently been solved, then lending a hand wouldn't be a problem.

3. When posting a question regarding programming, post your code in [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) instead of posting it directly to the group discussion board.

4. Before posting questions make sure you've Googled your problem/question. Remember that Google is a friend if you know how to ask it in a way that, will respond to you the way you wanted it to be. A [guide](https://www.facebook.com/notes/pinoy-it-geeks/how-to-use-and-maximize-google/512001068881778) has been provided for further reading.

5. Any technology related posts/questions are welcome. As for unrelated ones, we restrict them for a post in *n* intervals depending on trend.

6. Advertisements of sites are restricted to related content. Advertisements of groups is not allowed until sanctioned by the administrators.

7. Begging for likes is strictly prohibited.

8. Please refrain posting NSFW content to the community board to avoid being scolded by your bosses

9. It is better to answer inquiries through the thread not through private messages.

### Advertising
You may only advertise tech related events, websites, etc. Any other advertisements will be removed on sight.

### Hacking
All hacking topics are welcome except for blackhat related activities.

### Selling
The group never has been a marketplace and never will be a marketplace, although we give a little exception to sell technology related items **IF** you wouldn't need them anymore.

### Banning
Admins may ban anyone in their own discretion with or without a reason to preserve the interests of the group as a whole.
