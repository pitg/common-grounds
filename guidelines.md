# Pinoy I.T. Circlejerks' Guidelines
There is a saying that rules are never meant to be followed but serve as guidelines. Guidelines however are for maintaining the status quo.

### Overview
PITG observes [meritocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy), you are most welcome to discuss inquiries that relate to your field otherwise practice the field of interest first before entering into a discussion.

### Speech & Opinion
1. Ad Hominem : Simply speaking "to the person", it is a statement directed to the person instead to the argument. Be reminded that in an event of flakking whomever is involved; Do not resort to Ad Hominem for predujicial reasons. 

2. Respect : To simple things out, respect is earned and given not demanded nor asked.

3. Imperative Sarcasm : It is a part of the group's culture to include imperative sarcasm to their statements to give spice to the topic. Sarcasm may be considered as *relative trolling*.

4. Trolling : It's a norm, get over it.

5. Don't be a cry baby, you're only seeing the tip of the iceberg of the real world.

### Inquiries
1. When posting questions, be sure that they are descriptive as possible, and make sure that no single important detail is left behind; Do not take vagueness into account like "who knows x, i have a problem". Ask intelligently to avoid flak from admins or mainstays.

2. Spoonfeeding is frowned upon, you may only give hints to help them solve their own problem. **EXCEPT AND IF** the problem cannot be reproduced or recently been solved, then lending a hand wouldn't be a problem.

3. When posting inquiries in regards to programming, post your code on [Ideaone](http://ideone.com/) or [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) instead of posting it directly to the group discussion board.

4. Before posting inquiries make sure you already researched about it. Google is your friend. A [guide](https://www.facebook.com/notes/pinoy-it-geeks/how-to-use-and-maximize-google/512001068881778) is provided for further reading.

5. Any technology related inquiries are welcome. Unrelated content is restricted on certain *n* intervals depending on trend.

6. Begging of any kind is strictly prohibited.

7. Please refrain posting NSFW content to the community board to avoid being scolded by your bosses

8. It is better to answer inquiries through the thread not through private messages.

### Advertising
Advertisements of any kind are restricted to related content. Advertisement of groups or websites are not allowed until sanctioned by the administrators. You may message any admin on the group for this.

### Hacking
All hacking topics are welcome except for blackhat related activities.

### Selling
The group will never be a marketplace, although we give a little exception to sell technology related items **IF** you don't need them anymore.

### Banning
Admins may ban anyone on their own discretion w/o a reason to preserve the interests of the group as a whole.
