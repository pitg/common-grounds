##### References
1. This is not a major requirement, although respect is not supposed to be given without being deserved. If you can't respect. This goes also to the admins, if you can't respect one because he's being a prick. Then don't give him the respect he needs. Just don't break the barrier.

2. Any information deemed to be private such as, *the details provided in your birth certificate* which are not disclosed publicly or voluntarily by the user are protected by the rights/privileges given by this group.

3. There will be certain scenarios whereas unrelated content would be allowed to linger in the group board by the discretion of a certain admin.

4. We are entitled to learn things on our own, as we strive something that is harder.  It will soon bear to fruit in the future. Remember the saying "Give a man a fish, and he will live for a day; Teach a man how to fish, and he will live for a lifetime".

5. Please, by all means, learn how to read the thread before posting your reply to avoid re-bumping "SOLVED" threads and/or "reinventing the wheel" so to say.

6. For the sake of readability of code, all codes should be posted on pastebin or similar sites for easy access.  It is difficult to read code that is not in the proper format.

7. There have been cases of people using or should I say "invoking" the word "respect" on their respective post.  This is viewed as a gag against any frank but honest comment for the sake of just seeing the answers they want and avoid criticism.  Respect is something that will only be given and earned; not asked. Such use of the word will be deemed as offensive.
